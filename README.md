 Hi, I'm Max, a software engineer who loves the ever-changing programming landscape and learning new tools, editors, programming languages, and front-end frameworks to create useful software for users. 
 
 My teammates have told me that I’m the person they turn to when they’re stuck because I won’t stop until I overcome the challenge. I thrive in environments with tough problems because I am motivated to debug code and I truly enjoy the process of digging into resources to figure out an effective solution.

When I'm not coding, you can find me listening to music, exploring the city with my friends, or cheering on the Knicks and the Jets.

Skills: React, Postgres, Node.js, Express, Git
